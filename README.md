# realtime-chess-websocket Turn-Based Chess-like Game

This project is a turn-based chess-like game developed as part of the Hitwicket coding challenge. The game uses a server-client architecture with WebSocket-based real-time communication. The server is implemented using Python and Flask, and the client is a simple HTML page.

## Features

- **Turn-Based Gameplay**: A two-player turn-based game where players can interact with the board.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Uses WebSocket for real-time updates between server and client.
- **Simple UI**: A minimalistic HTML-based user interface.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Flask 2.3.2
- websockets 11.0.3
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShashankByalla/realtime-chess-websocket.git
cd realtime-chess-websocket
```

### 2. Set Up the Python Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

### 1. Start the WebSocket Server

Navigate to the `server` directory and run the server:

```bash
cd server
python server.py
```

The server will start on `ws://localhost:8765`.

### 2. Open the Client

Open the `client/index.html` file in your web browser. You can either double-click the file to open it directly or serve it using a local web server.

If you're using Python, you can start a simple HTTP server with:

```bash
cd client
python -m http.server
```

Then, navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to open the game.

## How to Play

- **Objective**: Players take turns to make moves on a 5x5 grid.
- **Winning Condition**: The simplified example checks if a player occupies the center of the grid.
- **Making a Move**: Click on an empty cell to place your mark (Player 1 or Player 2).
- **Turn Management**: The game will prompt the current player's turn in the UI.
